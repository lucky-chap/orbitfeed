## Intro üìú

## Inspiration üîÆ

In today's fast-paced, feedback-driven world, collecting and acting on user input is crucial for continuous improvement. However, existing tools often lack the collaboration features necessary to make feedback management a seamless experience for teams. Our inspiration was to create a tool that not only simplifies feedback collection but also fosters collaboration among team members, making the process more efficient and productive.
